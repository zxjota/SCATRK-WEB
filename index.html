    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>September 10, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>SCATRK</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices regarding that information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> Account information, email address, profile name, support requests, and other content you submit directly to the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage and device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (e.g., advertising identifiers), app usage statistics, crash reports, and performance data.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and cookies:</strong> Information collected through cookies and similar technologies to understand usage patterns and improve the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> We do not collect precise location data unless you explicitly enable and grant permission. If you permit location access, we may collect coarse or precise location to provide location-dependent features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
      <li>Personalize and optimize your experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to your questions, feedback, and support requests.</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the Service.</li>
      <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues and security incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics providers, crash reporting).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or government request, or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, asset sale, or bankruptcy—users will be notified if your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service may use third-party services (such as analytics or crash reporting tools) that collect, monitor, and analyze usage data. These third parties have their own privacy practices; we encourage you to review their policies. We are not responsible for third-party practices or content.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our partners use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to operate and improve the Service, to remember preferences, and to provide analytics. You can control cookies through your device or browser settings, but disabling cookies may affect certain features.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes, including complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. When data is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, and you acknowledge the inherent risks of data transmission over the internet.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, object to processing, or request portability. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email address below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling such requests.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We operate internationally. Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. When transferring personal data across borders, we use appropriate safeguards required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the “Effective date” at the top. Material changes will be posted or otherwise communicated in a prominent manner.</p>
